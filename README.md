# RREF-Calculator

This Python script computes the Reduced Row Echelon Form (RREF) of a given matrix. The RREF is a critical representation of a matrix, simplifying linear algebra operations for the analysis and solution of linear systems of equations.

## Usage

1. **Clone the Repository:**
   Open your terminal or command prompt and clone the repository to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Garvit240205/RREF-Calculator.git

2. **Navigate to the Project Directory:**
   Use the cd command to change into the directory of the cloned repository:

   ```bash
   cd RREF-Calculator

3. **Run the Python File:**
   Execute the Python file using the python command.
   
   ```bash
   python mathsbestversion.py

## Output

The script performs Gaussian elimination to convert the input matrix to its Reduced Row Echelon Form (RREF). It then provides the RREF matrix along with information about free variables, fixed variables, and the general solution in parametric form.
